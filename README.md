# GhostGame
A simple console game made with Python 3
# How to play
- You have to choose a door number between 1 and 3
- There is a ghost behind one of these doors
- If the door you pick hasn't got a ghost behind it, you score 1 point.
- If the door you pick has a ghost behind it, the game ends.
# Dependencies
- Python 3.X.X (I'm testing with Python 2 as well)
- playsound python library
  - To install the playsound library, with python installed, run `pip install playsound` in a terminal window.
  - If the game doesn't detect playsound, it will tell you and the game will still run, though the sound effects won't be played.
